# HW1-KNN IMPLEMENTATION FOR CLASSIFYING WINE DATA

## üç∑Project Overwievüç∑
This code is classifying the wine data according to their several features by using two variants of knn algorithm (different distance calculations and for several values of 'k')
*makes predictions, 
*calculates the accuracy score, 
*shows the confusion matrix 
*and displays the classification report.


## Requirements
### Dataset
*To run the code, you need to upload the dataset.
You can find the required files in the link below. You should download it and upload it to the code when it is asked.

### Libraries
*Other requirements are the libraries that are used in the code. You may need to download them to run the code without any problem. numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn are used in this code.

## Customization Options
You can customize the following in the code:
*the k value (you can choose 3, 5, 7, 9 etc)
*distance calculation method (Euclidean, Manhattan) 
*You can calculate accuracy score of each or you can modify the code to display the confusion matrix and classification report for another value than default one (Euclidean, k=3)
*you can customize the test and training data percentages
